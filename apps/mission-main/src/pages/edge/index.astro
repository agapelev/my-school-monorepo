# You've reached the fallback page.

This page is using a [Netlify Edge Function](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/) to rewrite the URL based on visitor geography.
If you got here, please check if Astro's Netlify Adapter is installed and included in your Astro configuration file.

Edge Functions are framework-agnostic, but are also used behind the scenes to run Astro Middleware on Netlify.
There are advatanges to using Edge Functions directly, such as the ability to access & transform the response body.
